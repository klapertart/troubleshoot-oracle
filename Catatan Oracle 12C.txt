+ Two types of database in Oracle 12c
	- CDB, Container Database
	- PDB, Pluggable Database
	
	* PDB in CDB

+ User
	- For CDB called Common Users
		- if we create user, use C##, for example:
		
		  SQL > create user C##PBB identified by PBB;
		  
	- For PDB called Local Users
		- if we create user, theres step have to do :
		
		  SQL > create user fred identified by flintstone container=current;

+ The solution to the ORA-06596 
	- is to set a hidden parameter "_oracle_script".  
	  When you set the undocumented (hidden) parameter "_oracle_script"=true  
	  you can create the fred user without a C## in from of the user ID.  
	  However, this user will not used useful in a pluggable/container database:

	  SQL > connect system/manager as sysdba
	  SQL > alter session set "_ORACLE_SCRIPT"=true;
	  SQL > create user fred identified by flintstone;
	  SQL > grant dba to pubs; 

+ The solution to ORA-28040: No matching authentication protocol exception
	- Set SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION=8 in the oracle/network/admin/sqlnet.ora file
	- ALTER SYSTEM SET SEC_CASE_SENSITIVE_LOGON = FALSE 
	- ALTER USER [XXX] IDENTIFIED BY [PWD]
	
+ The solution to The selected Oracle database is not configured to use the AL32UTF8 character set :
	- Open SQLplus and login using a sysdba role.
	- One by one, execute the next statements.
	
	  SQL> shutdown immediate;
	  SQL> startup restrict;
	  SQL> alter database character set internal_use AL32UTF8;
	  SQL> alter database character set AL32UTF8;
	  SQL> shutdown immediate;
	  SQL> startup;
	  
	- Exit SQLPlus

+ Change container / change to pdb 
	- SQL> alter session set container = [cdb / pdb name];

+ Check current container
	- SQL> show con_name;

+ The solution to create user db/shcemas in pdb
	// login into cdb (or system)
	- $> sqlplus / as sysdba
	// connect to pdb
	- SQL> alter session set container = sismioppdb;
	// create user
	- SQL> create user pbb identified by pbb;

+ The solution to ora-39087 directory data_pump_dir is invalid.
	- SQL> create directory data_pump_dir as '[path]'
	- SQL> grant read, write on directory data_pump_dir to [user]
	
+ The solution to ORA-01109: database not open
	- SQL> alter database open

+ Data Pump Dump Location
	- SQL> select * from dba_directories where directory_name='DATA_PUMP_DIR';  

+ Check Current connection
	- SQL> show con_name;
